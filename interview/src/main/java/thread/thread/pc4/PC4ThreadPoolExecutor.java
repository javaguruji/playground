 *
 *
 * Good software design techniques suggest that threads should not be created and destroyed manually.
 * Thread creation and destruction are expensive processes which consume both CPU and memory,
 * as they require JVM and OS activity. Default Java thread stack size is 1 MB for 64-bit JVMs.
 * That is why creating a new thread for each request when requests are frequent and lightweight is a waste of resources.
 *
 * Thread pools can handle thread lifecycle automatically according to the strategy selected on thread pool creation.
 * An important feature of a thread pool is that it allows applications to degrade gracefully.
 *
 * It holds a limited number of idle threads and reuses them when it needs to solve tasks.
 * This way, we donâ€™t have to create a new thread every time for a new request, and therefore,
 * we can avoid reaching a thread starvation.
 *
 * For running some tasks concurrently, you have to put them in the task queue. Then, when a thread is available,
 * it will receive a task and run it. The more available threads, the more tasks that are executed in parallel.
